   <h1>Giant panda</h1>
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Because of the synchronous flowering, death, and regeneration of all bamboo within a species, the giant panda must
      have at least two different species available in its range to avoid starvation. While primarily herbivorous, the
      giant panda still retains decidedly ursine teeth and will eat meat, fish, and eggs when available. In captivity,
      zoos typically maintain the giant panda's bamboo diet, though some will provide specially formulated biscuits or
      other dietary supplements.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">&#91;74&#93;</a></sup>

   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Pandas will travel between different habitats if they need to, so they can get the nutrients that they need and to
      balance their diet for reproduction. For six years, scientists studied six pandas tagged with GPS collars at the
      Foping Reserve in the Qinling Mountains. They took note of their foraging and mating habits and analyzed samples
      of their food and feces. The pandas would move from the valleys into the Qinling Mountains and would only return
      to the valleys in autumn. During the summer months, <a href="/wiki/Bamboo_shoot" title="Bamboo shoot">bamboo
         shoots</a> rich in protein are only available at higher altitudes which causes low calcium rates in the pandas.
      During breeding season, the pandas would return to lower altitudes to eat bamboo leaves rich in calciu
